For all symbols that support option trading, the standard monthly option expiration rule is as follows:

## Standard Monthly Option Expiration Rule

- Monthly options typically expire on the third Friday of each expiration month.

- If the third Friday falls on an exchange holiday, the expiration date moves to the third Thursday of that month.

- Expiration occurs at the close of trading, which is generally 4:00 PM Eastern Time (ET) on the expiration date.

- The last day to trade monthly options is the expiration day itself.

- After market close on expiration day, in-the-money options are typically automatically exercised, while out-of-the-money options expire worthless.

It's important to note that while this is the standard rule, there can be exceptions or variations:

- Some exchanges may have slightly different rules or timings.
- Certain products, like index options, might have different expiration processes.
- Weekly and daily options follow different expiration schedules.
- LEAPS (Long-Term Equity Anticipation Securities) have longer-term expirations, typically years in advance.

Always verify the specific expiration details for each option contract you're trading, as rules can vary by underlying asset, exchange, and option type.
